Participant Name: Hover over the name to see a list of involved adults.
Start Date: Enter the date of the health event, and GoEngage calculates statuses and deadlines based on the child's start date, HSPPS mandate windows, and EPSDT schedule.
Case notes icon: Sending any message to parents automatically creates a case note.
Health package icon: Centralizes all health events, regardless of where they were entered.
Upload attachment icon: For adding documents to the child's record.
Quick Form icon: Provides quick access to forms.
Data Entry:

Click the flag to view the child's EPSDT schedule.
Hover over the flag to see the health event deadline.
"Catch-up" refers to the EPSDT window for that age.
Click the text to enter data and add new records.


Flag color key:

Green: current
Yellow: coming due
Red: past due
Blue: completed late
Hollow flags (green outline, blue outline) indicate concerns discovered during the health event
